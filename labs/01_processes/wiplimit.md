# Home Assignment: WiP Limit and Cycle Time

As you have have learned during the lectures, »Little's Law« describes the fact, that the time to finish work will increase once you start additional work.

In this exercise you will investigate in the impact of WiP limits when multiple stations are chained to each other.

Premises:
* 4 Stations 
* Station 1: Development (duration 3 days)
* Station 2: QA / Testing (duration 1 day)
* Station 3: Acceptance tests (duration 2 days)
* Station 4: Roll-out7Deployment (duration 1 day)

Tasks:
* Question 1: What would be the optimum WiP-Limit per station to achieve a maximum throughput in your pipeline?
* Question 2: What cycle time will result from your WiP limit chosen?
* Question 3: How would you interpret these results. Briefly explain your observation.
